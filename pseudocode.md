## Main Objective
Build a weather app using a API fetch (with axios) that allows the user to search current weather information. Weather App will allow the user to input a zipcode in the US which should pull up the city searched, temperature, weather condition, and other info such as an image of the weather condition.

## Goals
- Use https://openweathermap.org/â€™s API to fetch weather data.
- Allow the user to enter their location (zip code is probably easiest) and press a button to load the weather.
- Run an onClick or onSubmit that executes an Axios or fetch GET request to retrieve weather data from the API.
- Handle successful and unsuccessful attempts
- If the request is successful, display the following in a 'mobile app' format:
- City name
- Current weather conditions
- Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celsius
- A unique image, decided by the current temperature (The API has icons built-in, be sure to read the docs)
- If the request is unsuccessful, display a specific error message such as "Invalid Zip Code" or anything else that might come back from the API.
- Allow the user to continue entering new zip codes to get new weather data.
